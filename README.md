# To-Do App

Hey, I am excited and proud to share you that today I had developed my first real-world application, a To-Do App.

I developed this app using frontend technologies: HTML & JavaScript.

NOTE: The 'main' branch contains the initial/older version of To-Do App & 'updated' branch contains the latest/updated version of the To-Do app, which is developed by me.

The To-Do App, which I had developed has basic features like: adding tasks in the To-Do list, removing tasks from the To-Do list, and viewing the To-Do lists.
 
In JavaScript, I used the event listeners to get the tasks entered by the user and updated the to-do list.

I enjoyed engineering this mini-project To-Do List, which is decent and solves a real world problem of managing and prioritising the tasks of the day. It took me around 30 minutes to build the logic and code the program.
